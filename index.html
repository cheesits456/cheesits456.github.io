							This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) applies to the
							<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cheesits456.dev">cheesits456.dev</a> website
							(&quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products and services
							(collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) and outlines how this Website operator
							(&quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) addresses
							copyright infringement notifications and how you (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) may
							submit a copyright infringement complaint.
						</p>
						<p>
							Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and
							their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear
							notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital
							Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) of 1998, the text of which can be found at the
							U.S. Copyright Office
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov">website</a>.
						</p>
						<h3>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h3>
						<p>
							Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact
							infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.
						</p>
						<p>
							The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the copyright infringement
							notification. If you are concerned about the privacy of your personal information, you may
							wish to
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns"
								>hire an agent</a
							>
							to report infringing material for you.
						</p>
						<h3>Notifications of infringement</h3>
						<p>
							If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material
							available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright
							infringement notification (&quot;Notification&quot;) using the contact details below
							pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may
							refer to a
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/create/dmca-takedown-notice"
								>DMCA takedown notice generator</a
							>
							or other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of your
							Notification.
						</p>
						<p>
							Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be
							reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these
							requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly
							infringing material. We may also require a court order from a court of competent
							jurisdiction, as determined by us in our sole discretion, before we take any action.
						</p>
						<p>
							If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a
							Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the
							affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access.
						</p>
						<p>
							Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the
							Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement
							notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such
							notifications.
						</p>
						<p>
							The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies
							we may have to address suspected infringement.
						</p>
						<h3>Changes and amendments</h3>
						<p>
							We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services
							at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Policy on the Website.
							When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
						</p>
						<h3>Reporting copyright infringement</h3>
						<p>
							If you would like to notify us of the infringing material or activity, you may send an email
							to
							<a target="_blank" href="https://social.cheesits456.dev/email"
								>&#108;&#101;&#103;&#97;l&#64;c&#104;e&#101;&#115;&#105;&#116;&#115;4&#53;6.d&#101;&#118;</a
